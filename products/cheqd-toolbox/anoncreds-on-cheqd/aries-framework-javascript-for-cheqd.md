# ðŸ“¦ Aries Framework JavaScript for cheqd

## Overview

[Aries Framework JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript) is a framework that enables users to quickly and easily issue, hold and verify Verifiable Credentials. The main goals of AFJ are: interoperability between all the Aries implementations, usability for non-SSI developers and to remain agnostic of the credential format or DID method that is used and to lead the way in terms of interop.

In the recent months AFJ has heavily been expanding into a more modular and "less specific" framework. The integration with cheqd is a prime example of this, being the first true showcase of anchoring AnonCreds on non-Indy ledgers Supporting more credential formats, ledgers and DID methods is crucial and essential to the continual development of AFJ.
