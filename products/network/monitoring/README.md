# Network Monitoring

## Context

Over the course of cheqd's product development we have identified various tools required to help the cheqd team, cheqd validators, and community members better monitor the network.

These include:

- [cheqd Block Explorer](block-explorer.md)
- [Validator Status API](validator-status.md)
- [cheqd x Cosmos Data API](data-apis.md)
  
All of these are open sourced and available to be used within your project.
