# v0.6.9

## Hgh-risk security vulnerability patch

## Context

The following steps have been prepared by the cheqd development team for cheqd validators to follow in order to manually upgrade their node.

This is in response to [a high-risk security vulnerability (dubbed "Dragonberry")](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702) related to IBC protocol / ICS23.

This is [closely related to the "Dragonfruit" security vulnerability published on Cosmos forums](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/cosmos-sdk-security-advisory-dragonfruit/7614). v0.6.9 fixes this vulnerability by patching to [Cosmos SDK v0.45.9](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9) upstream.

## Considerations

This patch is non-state-breaking. This means that validators can switch to the new binary, and restart their node without necessarily needing an on-chain software upgrade (which is intended for consensus-breaking changes).

The patch has already been applied to [cheqd's own validator node](https://explorer.cheqd.io/validators/cheqdvaloper1lg0vwuu888hu4arnt9egtqrm2662kcrtf2unrs) and one of the other large validators (at the time of writing this).
