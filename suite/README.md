# 🟢 Why cheqd?

cheqd is a technology scale-up company that provides a market-leading solution for **verifiable data**, enabling participants to share, co-create value and transact.

The [cheqd network](https://www.cheqd.io/) delivers first of its kind **payment rails, customisable commercial models and governance structures for trusted data** (also referred to as authentic). This is referred to as **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**, **Decentralised Identity**, or **Web5**.

SSI is a user-centric methodology for **exchanging trusted data** in a more secure and privacy preserving manner. SSI is positioned to usher in the next generation of digital identities across open networks and forms the **technical foundation of #Web5.**

### cheqd provides the technical foundation for **emerging** #Web5 ecosystems
{% endhint %}

cheqd provides the foundational **technical and payment infrastructure** for trusted data ecosystems to form, inverting existing models of data ownership. Entities, whether they be companies, individuals or objects, build profiles of their own data that they have **full control over**, and **share access to this data with interested third parties**, or verifiers / receivers, when needed, and **with express consent**.

This enables cheqd wants to create **commercially viable SSI ecosystems** through **native payment rails** alongside the flow of Verifiable Credentials (VC) that enables transactions of trusted data. This is achieved through a new blockchain, built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network/), the cheqd Network. The cheqd network facilitates native payments in the [$CHEQ token](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cheqd/) for [W3C Verifiable Credential](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) exchanges.

## Why should **you choose** cheqd?

### 🆔 Identity the _**right**_ way

With cheqd network, [you can already](../updates/changelog/):

* Anchor [W3C Decentralised Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)(DIDs) with complete [DID Documents](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-a-decentralised-identifier-did/what-is-a-did-document)

* manage Verifiable Credential revocation status.

{% hint style="success" %}
_note: cheqd intends to be the first network to support both_ [_JSON and JSON-LD_](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)_, as well as an_ [_AnonCreds_](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/design/002-anoncreds/README.html) _whilst remaining conformant with the_ [_W3C VC Data Model_](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)\_\_
{% endhint %}

### 📈 Peak Performance at low cost

* cheqd is designed as a highly performant Layer 1 with high throughput. Built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://cosmos.network/), cheqd can process an estimated [10,000 TPS](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/pymnts-blockchain-series-what-is-cosmos/), benchmarking well beyond other leading networks such as Cardono ([250 TPS](https://messari.io/asset/cardano/metrics/network-activity)), Ethereum ([15 - 30 TPS](https://ethtps.info/))**,** Avalanche ([5000 TPS](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-cryptocurrencies-with-a-high-transaction-speed-in-2022/)) and Bitcoin ([10 TPS)](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/us-test-cbdc-hits-record-transaction-speed-12530262.htm)

#### Transactions per second across identity networks

| cheqd | Avalanche | Kilt  | EBSI  | Ethereum | Bitcoin | Hyperledger Indy |
| ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 7,500 | 5,000     | 1,000 | 1,000 | 20       | 10      | 4                |

* Gas fees on cheqd are a fraction of the cost of other networks, making it far cheaper to transact on the network and in time exchange credentials.

### 💰 Get paid for your part

* Whether running a [node on the cheqd network,](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/intro-to-defi-aspects-of-cheqd/what-is-a-validator-node-operator) or [delegating tokens to a Node Operator](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/intro-to-defi-aspects-of-cheqd/what-is-staking-and-delegation) to stake on your behalf, you can earn yield from staking rewards.
* The average APR for token staking is [8.97%](https://explorer.cheqd.io/)

### 💡 **New** commercial models for digital identity ecosystems

cheqd is building payment rails that enable customisable business models:

* A [Verifier / receiver of a Verifiable Credential can pay the Issuer](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) a nominal fee for verifying the Credential;
* A [Holder can pay the Issuer](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) to receive trusted digital data;
* A [Verifier can pay the Holder](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) to receive trusted digital data.

Through our payment rails, new business and revenue models for participants in the self-sovereign identity ecosystem can accelerate the adoption of the technology, making SSI into a more commercially viable technology, whilst keeping individuals in control of their own data.

### 🗳️ _Truly_ decentralised governance

* cheqd has created a highly commended [decentralised Governance Framework](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/)
* cheqd uses a [delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS)) model, using its native token $CHEQ, to enable fair and proportionate decision making on the network.
* As a token holder, [**with our easy to use governance dashboard**](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd/) **** you can vote on key governance decisions, such as whether the network should be improved in the way the core team has suggested, and even decide on how the [network Community Pool](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool) is used
* You are able to easily propose a new on-chain proposal with a deposit of 8000 $CHEQ using our [governance forum](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd)
* As an interested community member, you can use our [off-chain governance forum](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd) to propose changes and engage in discussion with the rest of the cheqd community without needing tokens

{% embed url="https://gov.cheqd.io/" %}

### 🌎 **Community Pool**

* With every transaction on the cheqd network [2% of the transaction fee](https://gov.cheqd.io/getting-started/learning-the-basics/network-parameters) is collected and added to a savings pot known as a [Community Pool](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool)
* This Community Pool that can be used accelerating the development of new features on cheqd, or even donating to good causes, such as environmental sustainability
* The cheqd Community Pool is currently just shy of [500,000 CHEQ](https://explorer.cheqd.io/), and [anyone can propose](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool) how this is used

> _"We're excited to join the cheqd community because of its focus on operationalising SSI business models through payment rails. For companies like us that want to build applications based on SSI that enable users to access services, the payment rail component is critical in ensuring that we offer customers a seamless payment experience. Gravity's business model is based on "pay per data", such that customers pay for the data exchanged based on the number of credentials and the types of claims contained within them. Leveraging cheqd's payment rail infrastructure is therefore vital for Gravity as our customer base expands and credential exchanges grow."_
