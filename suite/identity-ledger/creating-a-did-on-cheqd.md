# Creating a DID and DID Document

When a DID is created, it is typically associated with a private and public key pair. The public key will be visible in the DID Document. This allows the **controller/subject** of the DID to **generate proofs that are verifiable by anyone** that has the corresponding DID Document for that DID.

Take a look at our tutorials for creating DIDs on cheqd, using the cheqd CLI as well as VDR Tools CLI:
