# When should I consider using DIDs?

DIDs are entirely multifunctional, which makes their value quite hard to pin down to a few bullet points. Some of the main ways in which enterprises are beginning to use DIDs are as follows:

* [x] Cost reduction in identity checks (KYC, KYB)

Identity checks are burdensome and expensive for most enterprises, costing between **$2 and $10** for basic checks, and **upwards of $50** for complex background checks.

Identity checks are also **single-use**. Each company generally carries out its own checks, since there is no trustworthy data format for a customer to prove they have had their data checked already.

Through building trust natively into data through the use of [DIDs](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-a-decentralised-identifier-did) and [Verifiable Credentials](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-a-verifiable-credential-vc), the cost of KYC and KYB checks can reused at no charge.

* [x] Reduced risk of identity fraud and theft

There are frightening statistics of identity fraud and theft resulting from phishing: In its 2021 Annual Data Breach Report, the [Identity Theft Resource Center](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/) (ITRC) reported that 1,862 data compromises occurred in 2021, breaking the previous record of 1,506 set in 2017.

Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and hard to catch-out, and with people frequently working from home, the number of successful social engineering scams has increased by 14% in 2022 alone.

Through the use of an innovation called [Peer DIDs](https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/), you can prove to third parties that you are the sole, irrefutable person/entity that has been issued a Credential.

Fraudsters will be unable to steal your identity, since they will not have access to the Peer DID which is linked intrinsically with your device. No longer will a username and password determine the control of your data: rather your data will sit with you directly.

* [x] Counteract digitally-based scamming and phishing

With public DIDs, being able to tell that a company _really_ is the company they claim to be will be far easier. In the same way that _verified_ companies and persons have 'blue ticks' on social media - DIDs provide a tamperproof digital equivalent of the blue tick to all data and correspondence.

* [x] Improve customer satisfaction and trust in digital services

Trust online is currently hard. And managing countless password-gated accounts is becoming hugely inconvenient. Pivoting to DIDs and a decentralised data economy will afford customers a far more user friendly experience, whilst complying by design with evolving data protection regulation.
