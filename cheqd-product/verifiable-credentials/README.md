# âœ… Verifiable Credentials

cheqd is creating simple tooling to enable third parties to issue Verifiable Credentials, using cheqd DIDs, DID Documents and Schemas.&#x20;

### What is a Verifiable Credential (VC)?

A **Verifiable Credential ("VC")** is a tamper-evident data file with a set of claims about a person, organisation, or thing that can be **cryptographically verified**. These verifiable credentials can be used to build [Verifiable Presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-verifiable-presentations), which can also be cryptographically verified.
