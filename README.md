# Product Oveview

cheqd is a public, permissionless Layer 1 Network, built on the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) designed to carry out the following functions:

1. **Identity -** Capability for anchoring identity primitives (W3C standardised Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), Schemas);
2. **Payment Rails -** Payment rails for verified identity data, enabling new business and revenue models for participants in SSI ecosystems. For example, a Verifier can pay the Issuer a nominal fee for verifying a Credential, or a Holder can pay the Issuer to receive trusted digital data;
3. **Performance  -** A highly performant Layer 1, with high throughput and Transactions Per Second, through building with the Cosmos SDK;
4. **Decentralised Governance -** Decentralised governance framework, using a delegated Proof of Stake model and native token for voting and major network decisions;
5. **Rewards -** Staking rewards for running a Node on the Network or delegating tokens to a Node Operator;
6. **Community Pool -** A Community Pool (collected through a % of transaction fees on the Network) that can be used for donating to good causes, such as for environmental sustainability;

cheqd has been developed to fill a much needed gap within the SSI community. Its mission is to create the go-to payments network for authentic data which rewards all parties in the ecosystem, whether institutional or individual. This is crucial to move from silos of data to a new world where data is controlled by the individual and new data combinations and business models are possible.

cheqd wants to make it as easy as possible to create commercially viable SSI ecosystems through enabling native payments alongside the flow of Verifiable Credentials. This will be achieved through a new Layer 1, the cheqd Network, which enables native payments in a token, the **CHEQ**, in exchange for standardised W3C Verifiable Credentials. ‌

To support this objective, cheqd has built its own blockchain, using the Cosmos SDK. This is known as the **cheqd “Network”**. Through this Network, cheqd’s objective is to maximise the incentives for all members of the self-sovereign identity ecosystem (holders, verifiers, issuers and Node Operators) to increase participation in the Network (transaction volume and distinct membership).&#x20;

cheqd are building this in a way which is open, permissionless, transparent, standards-compliant and apolitical. As such, the payment rails are being architected in a way where they can also be utilised across other Layer 1 networks.&#x20;

The objective of cheqd's product is to deliver **digital trust in a more scalable and efficient way**, with the unique addition of payment rails for Verifiable Credentials.&#x20;

In its design choices, cheqd's product aims to increase efficiency, accessibility and interoperability in the way companies, individuals and self-sovereign identity (SSI) vendors interact with the cheqd network and other Layer 1 Utilities.

Through the cheqd network and cheqd SDK, we aim to provide our partners a more efficient alternative, with greater scalability, decentralisation and improved security than it's predecessors. By open sourcing our code, and building on industry-standard cryptography, we ensure that the network can be used by anyone within the SSI ecosystem and beyond. And through the use of modular drivers and extensions to other networks, cheqd delivers convenience and additional flexibility, making it suited to a cross-chain Web 3.0.
