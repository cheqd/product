# üü¢ Why cheqd?

cheqd is a **technology scale-up company** that provides a **market-leading solution** for **data** **ownership and value creation.**&#x20;

The [cheqd network](https://www.cheqd.io/) delivers first of its kind **payment rails, customisable commercial models and governance structures for trusted**\* (also referred as authentic) data, including **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).**&#x20;

SSI is a user-centric methodology for **exchanging trusted data in a more secure manner**. It is also widely believed to be the next generation of digital identities across open networks and is the technical foundation of **#Web5**.

cheqd brings **simplicity, ease and fairness** by inverting existing models of data ownership. Individuals can build profiles of their own data that they have full control over, sharing access to organisations only when needed and with express consent.&#x20;

This makes it **quicker, safer and cheaper** to create a profile on a new digital service, and to be able to switch to any competing offerings easily. No more forms. No more hassle. For the first time, individuals and the companies that validate their online identity, such as passport offices, banks and utilities, are financially rewarded.

cheqd wants to make it as easy as possible to create **commercially viable SSI ecosystems** through enabling **native payments alongside the flow of Verifiable Credentials**. This will be achieved through a new Layer 1, the cheqd Network, which enables native payments in a token, the [$CHEQ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cheqd/), in exchange for standardised [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). ‚ÄåTo support this objective, cheqd has built its own blockchain, using the [Cosmos SDK.](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk)

## Why should **you choose** cheqd?

### üÜî Identity the _**right**_ way

* With cheqd you can:
  * anchor [W3C Decentralised Identifiers ](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)(DIDs) with complete [DID Documents](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-a-decentralised-identifier-did/what-is-a-did-document);
  * issue & verify [JSON based JWT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json) and [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) Verifiable Credentials, secured by cheqd DIDs;
* Very soon you can:
  * issue & verify [AnonCreds](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/design/002-anoncreds/README.html), secured by cheqd DIDs;
  * store Verifiable Credential schemas on-ledger (required for [AnonCreds](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/design/002-anoncreds/README.html));&#x20;
  * manage Verifiable Credential revocation status.

{% hint style="success" %}
_note: cheqd intends to be the first network to support both_ [_JSON and JSON-LD_](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)_, as well as an_ [_AnonCreds_](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/design/002-anoncreds/README.html) _whilst remaining conformant with the_ [_W3C VC Data Model_](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)__
{% endhint %}

### üìà Peak Performance at low cost

* cheqd has been designed to be a highly performant Layer 1 with high throughout
* Built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk), cheqd can process an estimated [10,000 TPS](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/pymnts-blockchain-series-what-is-cosmos/), far more than other leading networks such as Cardono ([250 TPS](https://messari.io/asset/cardano/metrics/network-activity)), Ethereum ([15 - 30 TPS](https://ethtps.info/))**,** Avalanche ([5000 TPS](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-cryptocurrencies-with-a-high-transaction-speed-in-2022/)) and Bitcoin ([10 TPS)](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/us-test-cbdc-hits-record-transaction-speed-12530262.htm)&#x20;
* Gas fees on cheqd are also a fraction of the cost of other networks, making it far cheaper to transact on the network and in time exchange credentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
_note: cheqd's estimated 10,000 TPS is based on the CosmosSDK estimations which cheqd is built with_
{% endhint %}

### üí∞Get paid for your part

* Whether running a [node on the cheqd network,](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/intro-to-defi-aspects-of-cheqd/what-is-a-validator-node-operator) or [delegating tokens to a Node Operator](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/intro-to-defi-aspects-of-cheqd/what-is-staking-and-delegation) to stake on your behalf, you can earn a strong yield from staking rewards.
* The average APR for token staking is [8.97%](https://explorer.cheqd.io/)

### üí° **Innovate with new Business Models**

* cheqd is building never before implemented payment rails, for example:
  * a [Verifier / Receiver of a Verifiable Credential can pay the Issuer](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) a nominal fee for verifying the Credential;
  * a[ Holder can pay the Issuer](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) to receive trusted digital data;
  * A [Verifier can pay the Holder](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) to receive trusted digital data.
* Through the payment rails, new business and revenue models for participants in the self-sovereign identity ecosystem can accelerate the adoption of the technology, making SSI into a more commercially viable technology, whilst keeping individuals in control of their own data.&#x20;

### üó≥Ô∏èHave your say

* cheqd has created a highly commended [decentralised Governance Framework](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/)
* cheqd uses a [delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS)) model, using its native token $CHEQ, to enable fair and proportionate decision making on the network &#x20;
* As a token holder**,** [with our easy to use governance dashboard](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd/)**,** you can vote on key governance decisions, such as whether the network should be improved in the way the core team has suggested, and even decide on how the [network Community Pool](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool) is used
* You are able to easily propose a new on-chain proposal with a deposit of 8000 $CHEQ using our [governance forum](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd)
* As an interested community member, you can use our [off-chain governance forum](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd) to propose changes and engage in discussion with the rest of the cheqd community without needing tokens

### üåé **Community Pool**

* With every transaction on the cheqd network [2% of the transaction fee](https://gov.cheqd.io/getting-started/learning-the-basics/network-parameters) is collected and added to a savings pot known as a [Community Pool](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool)&#x20;
* This Community Pool  that can be used accelerating the development of new features on cheqd, or even donating to good causes, such as environmental sustainability
* The cheqd Community Pool is currently just shy of [500,000 CHEQ](https://explorer.cheqd.io/), and [anyone can propose](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool) how this is used&#x20;

## So who is involved already?&#x20;

* In a relatively short space of time since it's founding in November 2021, cheqd has amassed strong support with partnerships across the entirety of the SSI ecosystem.
* Through its network for SSI vendors, cheqd disrupts established identity paradigms and creates new trusted data marketplaces.&#x20;
* Our partnership network now includes **37 SSI vendors** and continuing to grow - the majority of which securing the [cheqd network as validators](https://explorer.cheqd.io/validators).&#x20;
* Additionally key investors include[ Outlier Ventures,](https://outlierventures.io/) [Evernym](https://www.evernym.com/) (recently acquired by [Avast](https://www.avast.com/en-gb/index#mac)), [Tendermint Ventures](https://tendermint.com/ventures/) (the venture arm of Ignite, a core contributor to the Cosmos Network) and many more.&#x20;

> _"We're excited to join the cheqd community because of its focus on operationalising SSI business models through payment rails. For companies like us that want to build applications based on SSI that enable users to access services, the payment rail component is critical in ensuring that we offer customers a seamless payment experience. Gravity's business model is based on "pay per data", such that customers pay for the data exchanged based on the number of credentials and the types of claims contained within them. Leveraging cheqd's payment rail infrastructure is therefore vital for Gravity as our customer base expands and credential exchanges grow."_
