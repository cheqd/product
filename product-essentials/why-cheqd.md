# ü§î Why cheqd?

cheqd is a **technology scale-up company** that provides a **market-leading solution** for data **ownership and value creation.** The platform delivers first of its kind **payment rails, customisable commercial models and governance structures for trusted**\* (also referred as authentic) data, including self-sovereign identity (SSI). SSI is a user-centric methodology for exchanging trusted data in a more secure manner. It is also widely believed to be the next generation of digital identities across open networks.

cheqd brings **simplicity, ease and fairness** by inverting existing models of data ownership. Individuals can collect their profiles on any service that they have full control over, sharing access to organisations only when needed and with permission. This makes it **quicker, safer and cheaper** to create a profile on a new digital service, and to be able to switch to any competing offerings easily. For the first time, individuals and the companies that validate their online identity, such as passport offices, banks and utilities, are financially rewarded. **Data is the new gold, and cheqd is the store of value.**

cheqd wants to make it as easy as possible to create **commercially viable SSI ecosystems** through enabling **native payments alongside the flow of Verifiable Credentials**. This will be achieved through a new Layer 1, the cheqd Network, which enables native payments in a token, the [$CHEQ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cheqd/), in exchange for standardised [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). ‚ÄåTo support this objective, cheqd has built its own blockchain, using the [Cosmos SDK.](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk)

## Why should **you choose** cheqd?

### üÜî Identity the _**right**_ way

* With cheqd you can:
  * anchor [W3C standardised Decentralised Identifiers ](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)(DIDs);
  * issue & Verify [JSON based JWT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json) credentials and very soon;
  * store Schemas on Ledger (required for [AnonCreds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/anonymous-credential));&#x20;
  * manage credential revocation status.&#x20;

### üìà Peak Performance at low cost

* cheqd has been designed to be a highly performant Layer 1 with high throughout
* Built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk), cheqd can process an estimated [10,000 TPS](https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/pymnts-blockchain-series-what-is-cosmos/), far more than other leading networks such as Cardono ([250 TPS](https://messari.io/asset/cardano/metrics/network-activity)), Ethereum ([15 - 30 TPS](https://ethtps.info/))**,** Avalanche ([5000 TPS](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-cryptocurrencies-with-a-high-transaction-speed-in-2022/)) and Bitcoin ([10 TPS)](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/us-test-cbdc-hits-record-transaction-speed-12530262.htm)&#x20;
  * _\[note: cheqd's estimated 10,000 TPS is based on the CosmosSDK estimations which cheqd is built with]_
* Gas fees on cheqd are also a fraction of the cost of other networks, making it far cheaper to transact on the network and in time exchange credentials.

### üí∞Get paid for your part

* Whether running a [Node on the cheqd network,](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/intro-to-defi-aspects-of-cheqd/what-is-a-validator-node-operator) or [delegating tokens to a Node Operator](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/intro-to-defi-aspects-of-cheqd/what-is-staking-and-delegation) to stake on your behalf, you can earn a strong yield from staking rewards.
* The average APR for token staking is [8.97%](https://explorer.cheqd.io/)
* As a token holder you can also have your say on decisions, whilst you earn...&#x20;

### üó≥Ô∏èHave your say

* cheqd has created a highly commended [Decentralised Governance Framework](https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/)
* cheqd uses a delegated Proof of Stake model and native token&#x20;
* As a token holder**,** [with our easy to use governance dashboard](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd/)**,** you can vote on key governance decision, such as whether the network should be improved in the way the core team has suggested, and even decide on how the [network Community Pool](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool) is used...&#x20;

### üåé **Community Pool**

* With every transaction on the cheqd network [2% of the transaction fee](https://gov.cheqd.io/getting-started/learning-the-basics/network-parameters) is collected and added to a savings pot known as a [Community Pool](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool)&#x20;
* This Community Pool  that can be used for donating to good causes, such as for environmental sustainability
* The cheqd Community Pool is currently just shy of [500,000 CHEQ](https://explorer.cheqd.io/), and [anyone can propose ](https://gov.cheqd.io/contributing/community-pool)to the CHEQ token holders how this is used&#x20;

### üí° **Innovate with new Business Models**

* cheqd are building never before implemented payment rails, for example:
  * a [Verifier / Receiver can pay the Issuer ](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3)a nominal fee for verifying a Credential or;
  * a[ Holder can pay the Issuer](https://learn.cheqd.io/overview/tokenomics/tokenomics-part-3) to receive trusted digital data.
* Through they payment rails new business and revenue models for participants in the Self Sovereign Identity ecosystem can be innovated to make SSI viable and ultimately put individuals in control of their data.&#x20;

## So who is involved?&#x20;

* Through its network for SSI vendors, cheqd disrupts established identity paradigms and creates new trusted data marketplaces.&#x20;
* The scale of distribution in the SSI space is unmatched - through its strong community of partners, cheqd engages with companies in various different industries, which further demonstrates the endless areas of opportunity for the application of SSI technology.
* In a relatively short space of time since it's founding in November 2021, cheqd has amassed strong support with partnerships across the entirety of the SSI ecosystem
* Our partnership network is now **37 strong** and continuing to grow - the majority of which securing the [cheqd network as validators](https://explorer.cheqd.io/validators).&#x20;
* Additionally key investors include[ Outlier Ventures,](https://outlierventures.io/) [Evernym](https://www.evernym.com/) (recently acquired by [Avast](https://www.avast.com/en-gb/index#mac)), [Tendermint Ventures](https://tendermint.com/ventures/) (the venture arm of Ignite, a core contributor to the Cosmos Network) and many more.&#x20;

## But don't just take our word for it...&#x20;

> "As SSI matures we're seeing innovation at every layer of the Trust Over IP stack. cheqd is the only ToIP Layer 1 public utility I've seen with a governance framework designed explicitly to evolve from permissioned to permissionless. Add to that cheqd's commitment to interoperability across all SSI ecosystems and its unique focus on SSI-based value exchange and you have one of the most exciting projects in SSI today."

> **Drummond Reed (Chief Trust Officer, Evernym; Co-Chair, ToIP Governance Stack Working Group; co-author, "Self-Sovereign Identity")**

> "Danube Tech has been a pionieer in DID technologies, and we see cheqd as a promising next step in the evolution of SSI networks. Operating a cheqd node will add value to our mission of enabling global interoperability of decentralized identity infrastructures."
>
> **Markus Sabadello, CEO DanubeTech**

> ‚ÄúOur well-being depends on reliable data provenance and secure authentication/authorization across humans, organizations, and systems. All the exciting use-cases for digital-first processes are in need of a truly open and portable identity & credentialing fabric, which is exactly what Cheqd provides. Our joint vision is that decentralized identity will be at the core of every cyber-physical system in the near future.‚Äù

> **Carsten St√∂cker,  CEO Spherity**

> "We're excited to join the cheqd community because of its focus on operationalising SSI business models through payment rails. For companies like us that want to build applications based on SSI that enable users to access services, the payment rail component is critical in ensuring that we offer customers a seamless payment experience. Gravity's business model is based on "pay per data", such that customers pay for the data exchanged based on the number of credentials and the types of claims contained within them. Leveraging cheqd's payment rail infrastructure is therefore vital for Gravity as our customer base expands and credential exchanges grow."
