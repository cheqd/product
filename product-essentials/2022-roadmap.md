# üõ£ 2022 Roadmap

## Roadmap Overview

Our focus is to expand the utility of the cheqd network for decentralised identity use cases. This is our core mission and vision and - the reason why - we have such a broad interest within the self-sovereign identity (SSI) vendor ecosystem.

We want to get to a point, quickly, where we can provide compelling answers to ‚ÄúWhat identity capabilities does cheqd network provide, and how do I build it into my apps as an app developer / software vendor?‚Äù

Equally important as a focus area is deeper integrations with the Cosmos and wider Web 3.0 ecosystem. Digital identity is a burning need across DeFi, CeDeFi, and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Web 2.0 apps that cuts across as a ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù, as well as being extremely important in ‚Äúverticals‚Äù such as NFTs and online/offline reputation.

### Quick Wins - Q1 2022

Each new release of cheqd software that we ship would aim for incrementally improving core functionality, which improves life for users (individual and enterprise), token holders, node operators and app developers.&#x20;

In this category (which we‚Äôve called ‚ÄúQuick Wins‚Äù), we have product features and improvements where the approach is well-known and understood within the SSI and Web 3.0 industries.

### Strategic aims: Identity (Q2 2022 and beyond)

Much of the basic identity functionality is currently live on the cheqd mainnet, but we‚Äôve been working on stability and security improvements (due to go-live by the end of January 2022) before we begin guiding app developers in earnest. Here are our product ideas in the identity space we believe will have the greatest impact in the short-term.\
