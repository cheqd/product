# üó∫ Roadmap

Our focus is to expand the utility of the cheqd network for decentralised identity use cases. This is our core mission and vision and - the reason why - we have such a broad interest within the self-sovereign identity (SSI) vendor ecosystem.

We want to get to a point, quickly, where we can provide compelling answers to ‚ÄúWhat identity capabilities does cheqd network provide, and how do I build it into my apps as an app developer / software vendor?‚Äù

Equally important as a focus area is deeper integrations with the Cosmos and wider Web 3.0 ecosystem. Digital identity is a burning need across DeFi, CeDeFi, and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Web 2.0 apps that cuts across as a ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù, as well as being extremely important in ‚Äúverticals‚Äù such as NFTs and online/offline reputation.

## Deep-dive by product topics

We have broken our roadmap down into three sections:

1. [Identity](product-essentials/roadmap/identity.md)
2. [Network infrastructure](product-essentials/roadmap/network-infrastructure.md)
3. [Cosmos and Web-3.0](product-essentials/roadmap/cosmos-and-web-3.0.md)

We would love your feedback on our product vision for 2022. We welcome engagement and feedback across a range of different forums, such as our [Community Slack](http://cheqd.link/join-cheqd-slack), [Governance forum](https://commonwealth.im/cheqd), and [Telegram Group](https://t.me/cheqd).
