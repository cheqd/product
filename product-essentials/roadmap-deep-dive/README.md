# üîé Roadmap Deep Dive

## Roadmap Overview

Our focus is to expand the utility of the cheqd network for decentralised identity use cases. This is our core mission and vision and - the reason why - we have such a broad interest within the self-sovereign identity (SSI) vendor ecosystem.

We want to get to a point, quickly, where we can provide compelling answers to ‚ÄúWhat identity capabilities does cheqd network provide, and how do I build it into my apps as an app developer / software vendor?‚Äù

Equally important as a focus area is deeper integrations with the Cosmos and wider Web 3.0 ecosystem. Digital identity is a burning need across DeFi, CeDeFi, and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù Web 2.0 apps that cuts across as a ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù, as well as being extremely important in ‚Äúverticals‚Äù such as NFTs and online/offline reputation.
