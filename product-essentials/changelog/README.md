# ðŸ—“ Changelog

## Changelog Overview&#x20;

Within the Product & Engineering team our goal is to release often.We plan on releasing an **On Chain Upgrade** once per month, with point releases where required (i.e. no breaking changes) in between.

### Release Timelines

To ensure we upgrade all nodes on the network in the most efficient way whilst maintaining due care to the upgrade process, we run the process in the following steps:&#x20;

* Testnet proposal (24 hour voting period)&#x20;
* Testnet upgrade
* Mainnet Upgrade Proposal
* Mainnet On Chain Upgrade&#x20;

The intention is for the mainnet On Chain Upgrade to take place on the final Wednesday of each month, with it's proposal 7 days prior to this on the previous Wednesday&#x20;

Coordination in case of upgrade failure will happen on our [Community Slack channel](https://cheqd-community.slack.com/archives/C02NWSZ6S5D)
